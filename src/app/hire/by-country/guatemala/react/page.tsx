        "problem": "Offshore time zones create a 12-hour feedback lag, turning simple UI reviews into multi-day ordeals.",
        "stakes": "This 'review latency' is a silent killer of momentum. Your feature velocity grinds to a halt, and your agile process becomes a frustrating game of telephone.",
        "prescription": "Eliminate the time-zone tax entirely. We assemble elite pods of React engineers in Guatemala with a guaranteed full workday of collaborative overlap, ensuring real-time architectural discussions and PR reviews.",
        "proof": "Teams with full time-zone overlap cut their PR cycle times by over 75%. See our <a href='/playbook/nearshore-vs-offshore' class='text-primary hover:underline'>Nearshore vs Offshore playbook</a> for the data.",

        "stakes": "A developer who doesn't grasp React's performance characteristics will build a slow, janky UI, leading to a poor user experience and a mountain of technical debt.",
        "prescription": "Move beyond resume theater to verifiable evidence. Our <a href='/playbook/bias-free-technical-hiring-axiom-cortex' class='text-primary hover:underline'>Axiom Cortex™</a> engine evaluates a candidate's deep understanding of React performance, state management patterns, and component API design.",

        "prescription": "Outsource the entire operational burden to our single, accountable platform. Our service includes a fully compliant Employer of Record (EOR), MDM-managed laptops, and comprehensive security and insurance coverage.",
        "proof": "Our SOC-aligned onboarding process, detailed in our <a href='/trust' class='text-primary hover:underline'>Trust Center</a>, ensures every engineer operates from a secure, managed workstation. We absorb the risk so you can focus on building your product.",

        "prescription": "We provide a transparent, all-inclusive pricing model that leverages Guatemala's cost advantages, giving you a predictable TCO that is often 40-60% lower than the fully-loaded cost of a US hire.",
